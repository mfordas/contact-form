Recruitment task Brainhub:

In the beginning, we want to ask you to create a simple app with React on the front end side and connected with simple API written with Node.js.

Please create a small application form for an event. The form should contain fields listed below:
First name (required)
Last name (required)
Email (required, valid email address)
Event date (required, simple date picker)

Our requirements:

The frontend should be written in React (using Redux will be very appreciated)
Data from form should be saved in DB (we suggest MongoDB)
Data from form should be validated before saving
Errors should be handled and displayed for the user
The app must be tested (It's your decision what kind of tests are necessary, please remember that this part of the task is very important to us).
UI is not important for us. You can use your favorite framework (for example Bootstrap) or write everything on your own.


If you have any questions, don't be afraid and ask.
The last recruitment stage will be meeting with us in our office.
